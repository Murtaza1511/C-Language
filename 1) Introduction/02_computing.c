-"Processor" stores data while "memory" stores the program and information
(Like numbers, text ,graphics, images, audio, video, instructions etc)

-All information are broken down and represented as numbers

-We can convert characters to numbers by ASCII(American standard code 
for information interchange)
        
-We can covert an image into sequence of 0's and 1's that if white then 1
and if black then 0. If a pixel is partially black and partially
white then which has higher percentage will be considered
